# Android-Token-Retrieval-App

Created 3/1/16

A simple android application made with Android Studio that demonstrates the use of Android Volley communications and the Singleton.java class. A token, in the form of a json-encoded object, is retrieved with a username and password. Then, the token is used to retrieve another json-encoded object, which is parsed into a "secret message" string that is displayed to the user.
